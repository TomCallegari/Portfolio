  This is my extremely serious, very quick bio page ... as you can see I have a sense of humor, as well as a keen
  knack for programming.  A love of data science, learning and analyzing complex ideas will also serve 
  me well when you hire me! What would you rather?  Someone who who does not love their job? Someone who was forced into
  STEM disciplines through overbearing parents? Or someone who discovered that their calling was Data Science and Analytics!

  <h3>CHOOSE ME!!!!!!</h3>
  <p class='Note'>
  <b>Note:</b> Don't let the chickens fool you, there is some fundamentally sound data science on your horizon.
