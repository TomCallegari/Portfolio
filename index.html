            An aspiring Data Science and Analytics professional, Tom Callegari is currently a student at
            the University of Toronto School of Continuing Studies Data Analytics Bootcamp. 
            <br/>
            <br>
            Prior to the bootcamp, Tom was a student in the 3-year Advanced College Diploma program in Sports Management at Humber College 
            where he achieved Honor Roll status and was one of two graduting students to win the Humber Award for Academic 
            Excellence and Internship Achievement. 
            <br/>
            <br>
            Prior to taking the plunge and returning to school, Tom was a Recruiter and Account Manager working in the Canadian
            skilled trades and manufacturing industries, working with clients such as GE, John Deere,
            the Royal Canadian Mint and WR Davis Engineering to solve their staffing needs. 
            <br/>
            <br>
            A lifelong fan of sports, Tom has worked seasonally for the Toronto Argonauts since 2009 and is currently in his sixth
            year as the in-stadium public address spotter.  During the 2017-2019 Humber academic year Tom completed his two semesters 
            of internship placements as a Ticketing Analytics Intern for the Argonauts and then Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment (MLSE). 
            He is proud member of the 2017 Grey Cup Champions front-office team where he completed a machine learning project to
            model season ticket holder propensities for renewal.
